                <p>Procrastination. The bane of your academic pursuance.</p>
                <p>You have yet again come across a trial of desperate time management,</p>
                <p>in which you must complete your tasks properly before dawn - with a suitable time left for rest for the morning.</p>
                <p>On this 9pm evening, what lays before you is a 10 page essay you haven't started nor planned for, with a morning deadline with</p>
                <p>no exception for lateness, and due to your tardiness in the class, you need a B on this paper if you want to pass the class.</p>
                <p>Other assignments collectively require your hand in finalizing - which luckily you only need probably an hour at most to do so.</p>
                <p>The devil is in the details. All this time, for all your work, and enough for your needed respite.</p>
                <br />

                <p>If I research my topic for 30 minutes it could really help with the time to get writing as fast as possible.</p>
                <p>10 pages ain't no joke, and it will take a while to write...but with that said, these pages also need a substantial</p>
