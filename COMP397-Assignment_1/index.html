                    Procrastination. The bane of your academic pursuance. You have yet again come across a trial of desperate time management,
                    in which you must complete your tasks properly before dawn - with a suitable time left to rest for the morning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On this 9PM evening, what lays before you is a 10 page essay you haven't started nor planned for, with a morning deadline with
                    no exception for lateness, and due to your tardiness in the class, you need a "B" on this paper if you want to pass the class.
                </p>

                <p>Other assignments collectively require your hand in finalizing - which luckily you only need probably an hour at most to do so.</p>
                <p>The devil is in the details. All this time, for all your work, and enough for your needed respite.</p>

                <p>What should you start first?</p>

                <p>Right...crap...how to approach this.</p>
                <p>If I research my topic for 30 minutes it could really help with the time to get writing as fast as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    Ten pages ain't no joke, and it will take a while to write...but with that said, these pages also need a substantial
                    quality considering my final grade is riding on them.
                </p>
                <p>...</p>

                    After 30 minutes of research and 2 hours of writing, you've orchestrated a paper of absolute drivel...or bullcrap, as your teacher
                    would describe after a sarcastic sniffing gesture, followed with the phrase,"Why is this the first thing I smell in the morning?"
                    With the quick references you managed to scrounge up, you've basically written the same arguments with only
                    some expanded ideas differentiating them...for ten pages straight.
                </p>
                <p>It is now 11:30PM.</p>
                <p>You know this isn't up to snuff - not even to pass as good bullcrap covered in the scent of roses.</p>
                <p>You still have an all-nighter to pull for the assignments, but if you want a good mark on this paper you'll need to...</p>

                    During your hour of research, you managed to make a nice outline of correlating ideas, relevant research references, and a strong thesis to help make
                    the 2 hour long writing a little easier. With a clear outline, you had enough brevity to consistently write thoughtout arguments with research to back it up,
                    and sum it up nicely with the main ideas intact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is now 12AM. You could go with your gut on a pretty okay essay, but it would be even more satisfying had you just another 30 minutes to properly edit;
                    besides, the assignments only need an hour to finish up anyway, and getting to sleep at 2AM would be enough.

                <p>
                    So...just finish what you need to finish in an hour and get on to that treadful essay,

                    A pattern of incorrect applications of certain concepts start to emerge; astonished, you furiously continue to analyze the pages until realizing

                <p>It is now 10PM. Luckily this conundrum has caught your eye, but now you have to deal with an extra time drag you can't really afford for a 10-page essay waiting to bleed the rest of your time.</p>
                <p>
                    So...revise and properly correct the assignments, or improvise a plan to finish them later?

                <p>
                    You have enough time in fact that after doing the essay this won't be such a bad all-nighter depending on how long you spend on it.

                <p>
                    It is now 10PM. There's a way to scrounge time from the essay for a good night's rest if you research for 30 minutes and write for an hour,
                    or since everything is according to an all-nighter's schedule, you might as well work your lasting efforts of time into this and should still be able to wake up in the morning.

                <p>
                    So...do the bare minimum, or pull an all-nighter?
