                <p>Procrastination. The bane of your academic pursuance. You have yet again come across a trial of desperate time management,
                   in which you must complete your tasks properly before dawn - with a suitable time left for rest for the morning.</p>
                
                <p>On this 9PM evening, what lays before you is a 10 page essay you haven't started nor planned for, with a morning deadline with
                no exception for lateness, and due to your tardiness in the class, you need a B on this paper if you want to pass the class.</p>

                <p>Other assignments collectively require your hand in finalizing - which luckily you only need probably an hour at most to do so.</p>
                <p>The devil is in the details. All this time, for all your work, and enough for your needed respite.</p>

                <p>What should you start first?</p>

            <div class="slide-text">
                <p>Most of the answers for these assignments were provided by an aquaintance, giving you lesser time needed to finish them.</p>
                <p>You haven't had much time to check them and your judgement of that aquaintance hasn't been misplaced so far.</p>
                <p>So...just finish what you need to finish in an hour and get on to that treadful essay,
                or at least take a minute to see your friend's answers afterwards?</p>

                <p>Right...crap...how to approach this.</p>
                <p>If I research my topic for 30 minutes it could really help with the time to get writing as fast as possible.</p>
                <p>Ten pages ain't no joke, and it will take a while to write...but with that said, these pages also need a substantial
                   quality considering my final grade is riding on them.</p>
                <p>So...how long should you research?
                <p><a href="#30Route">30 Min</a></p>
                <p>or</p>

                <p>After 30 minutes of research and 2 hours of writing, you've orchestrated a paper of absolute drivel...or bullcrap, as your teacher
                   would describe after a sarcastic sniffing gesture, followed with the phrase,"Why is this the first thing I smell in the morning?" 
                   With the quick references you managed to scrounge up, you've basically written the same arguments with only
                   some expanded ideas differentiating them...for ten pages straight.</p>
                <p>It is now 11:30PM.</p>
                <p>You know this isn't up to snuff - not even to pass as good bullcrap covered in the scent of roses.</p>
                <p>You still have an all-nighter to pull for the assignments, but if you want a good mark on this paper you'll need to...</p>

            <div class="slide-text">
                <p>During your hour of research, you managed to make a nice outline of correlating ideas, relevant research references, and a strong thesis to help make
                   the 2 hour long writing a little easier. With a clear outline, you had enough brevity to consistently write thoughtout arguments with research to back it up,
                   and sum it up nicely with the main ideas intact.</p>
                <p>It is now 12AM. You could go with your gut on a pretty okay essay, but it would be even more satisfying had you just another 30 minutes to properly edit;
                   besides, the assignments only need an hour to finish up anyway, and getting to sleep at 2AM would be enough.</p>
                <p>So...what'll it be?</p>
