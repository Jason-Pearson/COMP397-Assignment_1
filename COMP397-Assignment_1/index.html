                    Procrastination. The bane of your academic pursuance. You have yet again come across a trial of desperate time management,
                    in which you must complete your tasks properly before dawn - with a suitable time left to rest for the morning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On this 9PM evening, what lays before you is a 10 page essay you haven't started nor planned for, with a morning deadline with
                    no exception for lateness, and due to your tardiness in the class, you need a "B" on this paper if you want to pass the class.
                </p>

                <p>Other assignments collectively require your hand in finalizing - which luckily you only need probably an hour at most to do so.</p>
                <p>The devil is in the details. All this time, for all your work, and enough for your needed respite.</p>

                <p>What should you start first?</p>

                    After 30 minutes of research and 2 hours of writing, you've orchestrated a paper of absolute drivel...or bullcrap, as your teacher
                    would describe after a sarcastic sniffing gesture, followed with the phrase,"Why is this the first thing I smell in the morning?"
                    With the quick references you managed to scrounge up, you've basically written the same arguments with only
                    some expanded ideas differentiating them...for ten pages straight.

                    During your hour of research, you managed to make a nice outline of correlating ideas, relevant research references, and a strong thesis to help make
                    the 2 hour long writing a little easier. With a clear outline, you had enough brevity to consistently write thoughtout arguments with research to back it up,
                    and sum it up nicely with the main ideas intact.

                    besides, the assignments only need an hour to finish up anyway, and getting to sleep at 2AM would be enough.

                    Essentially, you spend 30 minutes on a quick revision with extra research and writing to expand on a few key ideas to carry the rest of the essay...more bullcrap, but hopefully the orchard of rose you encapsulated it with can make the smell only apparent to you.

                    You got a B, right on the mark, with your essay, and got B+'s on all assignments. Working with great coordination of how to approach your tasks, and even allowing yourself more time for any mishaps to correct, enabled substantial work to be done and handed in on time.
